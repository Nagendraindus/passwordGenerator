This small project uses html , css , JavaScript to generate password based on the length and the password choice given by the user.
# Background color "issue".
I have made the colors of the background random which generates random colors based on adding diffrent numbers from the letters to form a color hex code .
This can sometimes lead to very out of context colors.
You an make the background color static by removing the function getRandomColor(),
function setRandomBackgroundColor(),
setRandomBackgroundColor();
or you can even modify the random color by modifying these functions.ðŸ˜Š
